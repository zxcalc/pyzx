Extracting circuits from Graphs
==================================

The rules of the ZX-calculus allow for more general rewrites than if you were to restrict yourself to just circuit forms. The drawback of this is that it is not trivial to get back a circuit after you have done some rewrites. The file extract_ supplies some methods for retrieving a circuit from a ZX-graph. This uses the matrix calculations on binary matrices supplied in linalg_.
