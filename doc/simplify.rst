Rewriting and simplifying circuits
==================================

.. module:: simplify

To rewrite a circuit you generally want to use a *rewrite strategy*. These rewrite strategies in turn use some set of *rewrite rules*. In PyZX the rewrite strategies are contained in simplify_, while the rules are contained in rules_
