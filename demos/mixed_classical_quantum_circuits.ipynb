        " In traditional ZX-calculus, graphs model quantum operations using Z and X spiders ```(nodes)``` connected by edges. This script extends that concept using \"grounded\" vertices, which represent classical information, such as measurement outcomes or classically controlled operations. By setting ```ground=True``` on certain vertices, PyZX can distinguish quantum behavior from classical control, enabling modeling of hybrid algorithms, such as quantum teleportation, conditional gates, and variational circuits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, grounding a vertex allows it to behave like a classical node in a computational graph, thus mixing quantum operations (unitary evolution) with non-unitary classical branching or feedback. The demo walks through six structured examples: (1) basic ground operations, (2) measurement circuits, (3) classically controlled gates, (4) quantum teleportation via classical bits, (5) how grounded vertices affect simplification, and (6) a hybrid variational algorithm combining classical parameter optimization with quantum circuits. Each example uses ZX-graph construction and PyZX's hybrid utilities like is_ground, ```grounds()```, and ```is_hybrid()``` to show how measurement, control, and classical logic are naturally incorporated into the quantum circuit graph structure. This demonstrates that PyZX's graphical model can support full hybrid quantum-classical computation rather than just unitary-only quantum circuits."

This tutorial-style code walks through six core demonstrations using ```zx.Graph()``` objects—PyZX’s underlying graphical representation of quantum circuits, based on ZX-calculus. The key idea is that by marking certain vertices with ```ground=True```, we can distinguish classical information (like measurement outcomes or classical control signals) from purely quantum operations.\n",

The PyZX API provides tools like is_ground, grounds, and is_hybrid to analyze and manage these mixed-mode systems. This hybrid extension enriches ZX-diagrams beyond pure quantum logic, enabling simulations of full hybrid algorithms such as variational circuits, feedback loops, and teleportation—all within one unified graph model."

        "Let’s see how to build a simple classical circuit using the ZX-calculus with the `pyzx` library. In this introductory example, we construct a linear ZX-diagram that represents a basic classical signal flow using *grounded vertices*, which indicate classical (non-quantum) behavior. We start by creating an empty `Graph` object. Then, we add a **boundary input vertex** (`in_v`) at qubit 0 and row 0, with the `ground=True` flag to indicate it's classical. Next, we place two **Z-spiders** (`z1` and `z2`) at subsequent rows, also marked as classical. Finally, we add a **boundary output vertex** (`out_v`) at row 3. These vertices are connected sequentially using edges, forming a simple chain: input → Z → Z → output. We define the first and last vertices as the inputs and outputs of the graph, respectively. Mathematically, this structure resembles a classical signal passing through two identity operations (Z-spiders without phase), with no quantum entanglement or phase manipulation involved. It forms the simplest backbone for understanding classical data flow in ZX-diagrams.\n"
